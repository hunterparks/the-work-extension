# The Work Extension

When you need a little reminder!

## Description

Are you sometimes confused about the work you are doing? Install this extension for a (somewhat) not-safe-for-work reminder about what the work is all about. Once activated, a brief clip from the Apple TV+ series Severance will play and remind you about the work.

Please leave feedback if you have any suggestions/issues.
